Write a Python function that analyzes a loans dataset using only lists and the csv module.
Do NOT use pandas.

The CSV has columns: loan_intent, loan_grade, loan_amnt, loan_int_rate.

The function should:

Read the CSV file using the csv module.

Create a separate list for each unique loan_intent.

For each intent, store the loan_grade, loan_amnt, and loan_int_rate values inside that intent’s list.

For each loan_intent:

Find the most common loan_grade (use list counting or collections.Counter).

Calculate the average loan_amnt (convert to float).

Calculate the average loan_int_rate (convert to float).

Write the results into a new CSV file called loan_intent_analysis.csv with columns:

loan_intent

most_common_grade

avg_amount

avg_interest_rate
